# LMU Basketball Analytics

This repository is a little peek into some of the work I have done for LMU Basketball. Film review is a very important part of basketball and the level of film analysis continues to grow constantly. Film is used to help find ways to find strengths, learn from mistakes, and ultimately try to help improve the team and player to perform at the highest level. Another major area of growth in basketball has been the use of advanced analytics. In recent years, the use of analytics in basketball has surged, revolutionizing how teams evaluate player performance, develop strategies, and make in-game decisions. Advanced analytics have become integral tools for coaches, analysts, and front offices alike, reshaping the way the game is understood and played at all levels. Although film and analytics analysis are both great for the game and are improving constantly, there is a major disconnect between the two.

This film and analytics project aims to bridge the gap between film and analytics analysis leading to both areas being more effective when used together. The project uses the software [**Hudl SportsCode**](https://www.hudl.com/products/sportscode).

SportsCode is used as a video tool for various sports and is the main video organizational tool for every high level basketball team at the college or professional level. Although most basketball teams use it at a very basic level, we tried to break from the rest in our utilization of SportsCode. We utilized the "Code Window" feature in SportsCode to do so. The code windows in sportscode are fully customizable, where everything can be coded in their language (very similar to others) to do different things. For us, here are a few of the different things we were able to create valuable output windows that displayed different key statistics at both the team and individual levels. 

The two files in the GitHub repository show the applications of these code windows, both for practice and for games. The files attached are mp4 files that need to be downloaded directly from GitHub to be viewed. I have also uploaded each of the videos so that you do not need to download each video and can view them online. Here are the links to each:
