# LMU Basketball Analytics

This repository is a little peek into some of the work I have done for LMU Basketball. Film review is a very important part of basketball and the level of film analysis continues to grow constantly. Film is used to help find ways to find strengths, learn from mistakes, and ultimately try to help improve the team and player to perform at the highest level. Another major area of growth in basketball has been the use of advanced analytics. In recent years, the use of analytics in basketball has surged, revolutionizing how teams evaluate player performance, develop strategies, and make in-game decisions. Advanced analytics have become integral tools for coaches, analysts, and front offices alike, reshaping the way the game is understood and played at all levels. Although film and analytics analysis are both great for the game and are improving constantly, there is a major disconnect between the two.

This film and analytics project aims to bridge the gap between film and analytics analysis leading to both areas being more effective when used together. The project uses the software [**Hudl SportsCode**](https://www.hudl.com/products/sportscode).

SportsCode is used as a video tool for various sports and is the main video organizational tool for every high level basketball team at the college or professional level. Although most basketball teams use it at a very basic level, we tried to break from the rest in our utilization of SportsCode. 

What has been done here, though, is very advanced compared to the rest of the basketball world at any level, professional or college.
